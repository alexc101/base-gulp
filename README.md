run 'npm install' inside terminal at folder root to install dependencies. Download node.js for this;

Uses scss instead of CSS ( basically just CSS with nesting and imports, access these in dev file )

gulp will automatically compile scss to css when you save the file.

Edit javascript inside the dist folder (as well as html). Just leave the css file alone in there, I've included a small example
for how scss works.
